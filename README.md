# Project - Netflix Helper

## The Short Version:
Ever felt like you've spent more time searching Netflix for the /best/ movie than actually watching your favourite shows and movies? Perhaps you've been too afraid to click that play button, suspicious that you might actually be missing out on something better? This Netflix helper allows you, as the user, to set parameters and randomly generate Netflix content to watch! Get rid of that analysis paralysis, and get involved in what may be your next favourite movie.

## More in-depth user control:
The application allows you to: 
 * set parameters of genre, country and amount of results
 * automatically sets past searches into history to be displayed upon returning to the site
 * creates a button that sends you through to a random movie on netflix from your generated movie results, in case you really don't want  to decide yourself.
 * showcases the movie's poster, synopsis, title, run time and imbd rating for easier choices of your results
